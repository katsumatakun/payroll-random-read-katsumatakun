## Comments

* Good Job !!!  Just a few minor flaws
* test should not be part of all in Makefile.  You want to only run tests when you are ready so you would do "make test" to run the test.
* the output could be improved would be better to print a record per line not multiple - much harder to read the way you have outputted results.
